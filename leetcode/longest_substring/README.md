Given a string, find the length of the longest substring  
without repeating characters.

Examples:
```
"abcabcbb" -> "abc", which the length is 3.
"bbbbb"    -> "b", with the length of 1.
"pwwke     -> "wke", with the length of 3. 
```
Note that the answer must be a substring,  
"pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
